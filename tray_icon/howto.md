# tray-icon Python code contributed by @phil2sat

Here is some code which does what i need, its also possible to show and minimize again trough the trayicon
cpu usage of the process while minimized is for me at around 0.1-0.2% while streaming to my speaker
it needs also an icon.png in the same folder, can extract .ico with 7zip from .exe and save as png

pip install pywin32 pystray pillow

name it "swyh-rs.pyw" and copy into swyh-rs folder
